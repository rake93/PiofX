    <string name="aboutus_desc">As counting animals, vagueness and uncertainity in prime numbers
                surprises us. The gravity of this strange unpredictability kept bringing down
        scintistists and mathematicians.</string>

    <string name="aboutus_desc2">The prime counting function was the tool     that allowed them to reach
            escape velocity. To make sense of the infinite randomness of primes.At Pi of x,
            we wish to help you do the same - make sense of the randomness that is exam prep</string>
